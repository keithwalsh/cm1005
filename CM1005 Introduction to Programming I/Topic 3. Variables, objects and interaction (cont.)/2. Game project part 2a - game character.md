# Game Project Part 2: Drawing Your Game Character

In this video, we're going to get started with part two of the game project: drawing a game character.

## Setting Up

The first step is to download the sketch from the platform and run it. When you run the sketch, you'll see several boxes. Inside these boxes is where you'll draw different versions of your game character. The first box is for the character standing and facing front. The others are for actions such as jumping, walking left, walking right, jumping to the right, and jumping to the left. Adding these images into your game will create an animated effect as your character moves in different ways.

## Working with Variables

If you look at the code, you'll find two important variables: `gameChar_x` and `gameChar_y`. These are essential for the entire game project, and you'll use them each time you draw your character. It's important not to change these variables; instead, add your drawing code where indicated.

## Drawing the Character

Start by understanding where these coordinates sit in the image. First, draw a small black ellipse at (`gameChar_x`, `gameChar_y`). When you look at the output, the ellipse appears at the bottom center of your image. This will always act as your anchor point: the middle at the bottom.

### Drawing the Head

Now, let's begin drawing the character. We'll start with the head. Choose a pinkish color for the skin — for instance, try 200 red, 100 green, and 100 blue to get a suitable shade. Draw another, larger ellipse at `gameChar_x`, `gameChar_y` for now, with a diameter of about 25. If this doesn't look right, you can lighten the color slightly and increase the size of the ellipse as needed.

To position the head toward the top of the rectangle, subtract a value from `gameChar_y`, such as 50. This will move the ellipse upwards and look more natural.

### Drawing the Body

Next, draw the body using a red fill (`255, 0, 0`). Use a rectangle for the body, starting at `gameChar_x`, `gameChar_y`. Use this as a rough starting point, and adjust the size and position after seeing the initial outcome. Try a width of 50 and a height of 100, but you'll likely need to reduce the size—for example, try halving these values. 

Remember that rectangles are drawn from their top-left corner. To center the rectangle over your anchor point, subtract half its width from `gameChar_x`. For example, if the width is 26, subtract 13 from `gameChar_x`. Check your sketch to ensure it's centered correctly.

Position the body at the correct height by subtracting a value from `gameChar_y`, starting with 30. Adjust this value (try 35 if needed) to get it right. If the body looks too long, reduce its height further (e.g., make it 32).

### Drawing the Feet

For the feet, use black fill again and draw small rectangles. Start at `gameChar_x`, `gameChar_y`, and use dimensions like 10x10 pixels. Move the rectangle to the left-hand side, under the body, by adjusting its y-position (try subtracting 10; if that's too high, use 5). Then move it to the left by subtracting from `gameChar_x` (try 13, then 18, and settle on 15 for the best placement).

To draw the other foot symmetrically, copy the code for the first foot. Instead of minus 15, add 15 to `gameChar_x`. If this doesn't place the foot correctly, account for the rectangle's width and adjust (such as using plus 5).

Once your feet are correctly aligned, you can comment out the original black ellipse you drew as a positional reference.

## Next Steps

Your first game character drawing is now complete! For the remaining actions—jumping, walking left, walking right, and so on—it's up to you to adapt your drawing. For instance, to show jumping, you might shorten the body or extend the arms. To indicate facing sideways, consider a thinner ellipse.

Aim to keep your code manageable and avoid overcomplicating things. You'll need to copy and adjust this code several times later; keeping each drawing to about 10 to 15 lines will make your life easier. If your code is much longer, you might find future steps challenging.

Now it's your turn—best of luck!
