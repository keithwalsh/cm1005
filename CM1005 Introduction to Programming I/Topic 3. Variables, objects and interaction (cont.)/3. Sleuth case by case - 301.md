# Sleuth Case 301: The Python Syndicate

## The Usual Suspects

Let's look at our next case in Sleuth: the case of the Python Syndicate, also known as Case 301. The first stage here is called *the usual suspects*.

You can begin by downloading the crime file. This file will be placed into your Downloads folder. After extracting it, you can move it over to Brackets. Within the extracted files, you'll notice quite a lot of PNGs and our main sketch file.

In this case, our task is to rearrange mugshots of the Python Syndicate. We'll be accomplishing this using variables.

---

## Setting Up the Mugshots

If we run the sketch initially, you'll see that only one mugshot appears on the Canvas. Let's examine the sketch itself.

We're required to create a new variable for the `x` and `y` coordinates of each mugshot. One variable has already been created for us. It's important to maintain the same style and format for variable naming. This could either be camelCase or the underscore_style. In our example, the underscore style is used.

Your setup may differ—perhaps using camel case or different variable names and orderings—so you must be attentive to variable naming conventions to ensure everything works properly.

Looking closely, we see that the provided variable has set the coordinates for Anna Karpinski. That's the mugshot displayed in this initial hint. The next step is to create new variables for the other suspects.

---

## Creating Variables for Suspects

Let's start by creating one for Countess Hamilton, who is another character in this case. So far, we've got `countess_hamilton`. You can determine which mugshot variables you need based on these image variables near the top of your code.

We want to create an `x` and `y` variable for each mugshot. Let’s begin with Countess Hamilton:

1. For the x-coordinate: `countess_hamilton_x = ...`
2. For the y-coordinate: `countess_hamilton_y = ...`

If you're unsure about the values, scroll down in your code—there you’ll find a commented-out image call for Countess Hamilton that uses absolute numbers (sometimes referred to as "magic numbers"). For instance, using the numbers 115 (for x) and 40 (for y):

- `countess_hamilton_x = 105`
- `countess_hamilton_y = 40`

Now, uncomment this image line in code. If you run the sketch, you'll see Countess Hamilton's mugshot appear, although you’re not yet using your new variable. Let’s add the variable reference so that you use `countess_hamilton` for both coordinates.

Bracket suggestions can help with aiming for the correct variable name. Let it auto-complete, save your work, and notice that Countess Hamilton's mugshot appears in the same place, but now you’re using variables.

## Adding More Characters

Now, let's do another one or two characters and try grading the sketch to see how far we've come.

### Rocky Kray

Next is Rocky Kray. Here, a common pitfall: the variable name must match exactly. If you make a mistake with the name, such as using an inconsistent naming convention, this could affect your grading, so change the name wherever necessary.

For Rocky Kray:
- `rocky_kray_x_coord = 408`
- `rocky_kray_y_coord = 40`

Insert comments to clarify your code. Then, use these variables in the code where you draw Rocky Kray's mugshot.

Remember to save your work. With these adjustments, there should now be three images displayed.

## Grading and Next Steps

Should we try submitting for grading? Be aware that at this point, it's unlikely you'll receive all four marks.

To submit:
- Browse for your sketch file (e.g., "201" for Case 201 or "301 sketch file" for this one).
- Click Open, followed by Submit Solution.

After submitting, you'll receive feedback. For example, you may be told you haven't created a variable for Lina Lovelace, Robbie Kray, or Bones. However, if three mugshots are in the correct place and four variables are correctly initialized, you’re on the right track.

Three mugshots may remain in the wrong locations, and you'll need to create more variables to finalize the arrangement. Keep adding and correcting variables until all mugshots appear correctly.
