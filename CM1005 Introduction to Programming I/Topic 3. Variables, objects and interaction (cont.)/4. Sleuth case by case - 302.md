## The Slippery Minsky Brothers Case (Case 302)

This is our second case for the topic—the case of the Slippery Minsky Brothers (case 302).

### Setting Up

First, download the bank heist sketch form. This follows the standard crime procedure. Save it in your downloads as "302." Once downloaded, extract the files and open them up in your editor (for example, Brackets).

Inside the files, you'll find a sketch file and a scene file. The scene includes an image of Gates's Bank and a detective. Our goal here is to shine a spotlight from the detective all the way to the Minsky Brother.

### Exploring the Sketch

If you run the sketch form, you’ll see a blank screen for the spotlight, with a portion of the scene visible behind it. In this exercise, there are a few key things to do:

1. **Edit `startX`**: Alter the starting position of the spotlight.
2. **Edit `endX`**: Specify where the spotlight should stop when reaching the target.
3. **Animate the Spotlight**: Make the spotlight move perfectly from the detective towards Sergy Minsky by adjusting the increments of `x` and (if needed) `y`.

When done correctly, the spotlight should come to rest over Sergy.

### Determining Coordinates

Let’s inspect the scene and set the correct starting and ending positions for the spotlight:

- **Detective's coordinates**: (829, 111)
    - We focus on the x-coordinate: **829**.
- **Sergy Minsky's coordinates**: (289, 110)
    - Again, concentrate on the x-coordinate: **289**.

### Animating the Spotlight

Next, initialize `x` with the start variable:

- Set `x = 829`, since that's our starting position.
- You need to update the variable `x` to move the spotlight. Since you want the spotlight to move from right to left, reduce the value of `x` in each animation frame.

For example:  
`x -= 1` (that is, `x` minus equals one).  

This animates the spotlight, moving it by one pixel per frame from the starting position to the end location.

### Observing the Animation

Run the sketch to see how it behaves:

- The spotlight starts at the detective's position.
- It moves across the scene, heading towards the Minsky Brother.
- If implemented correctly, the spotlight should stop perfectly over Sergy.

### Submitting Your Solution

Once you’re satisfied, open up Sleuth again:

- Download case 302 if needed,
- Select the sketch,
- Open it,
- Submit your solution.

If everything was done correctly, you’ll have solved it on the first attempt.

### Further Levels

In later levels, you’ll also need to adjust the y-coordinate, which means you’ll update both x and y. Simply use increments or decrements of one for each (`+1` or `-1`), and vary these values so the spotlight moves at the correct angle.

**Remember:**  
You want to vary the variable values so that the spotlight moves and stops at the correct position and angle.
