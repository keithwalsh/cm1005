# Getting Started with Case 303: The Crooked Attorney

In this video, I'm going to show you how to get started with Case 303, also known as the case of the Crooked Attorney.

Let's go straight to Torvalds Office. We begin by downloading the crime that happened there. The usual process applies: unzip the folder, open the Brackets editor, and drag the folder into Brackets.

## The Setup

District Attorney Torvalds is well respected in Console City as an upstanding citizen and enforcer of the law. But, of course, he's as crooked as they come. Our goal is to find some incriminating documents, which Torvalds has hidden in various safes all across town. We'll need to break into these safes.

To crack the safes, we have a set of instructions and commands to follow. These tasks seem to revolve around two variables: `Cryptic_Store_CombA` and `Cryptic_Store_CombB`.

**Important:** Your puzzle may not be exactly the same as mine. Variable names and instructions might be different. You cannot copy this video exactly; you have to adapt to your own version.

## Running the Sketch

First things first, let's run the sketch. Once we do, we can see our safe. Initially, I thought it might be interactive, but for now, nothing happens. 

Let's try to crack this safe and see what needs to be done. I'll walk you through a few steps.

## Handling Mouse and Keyboard Events

When the mouse button is released, we need to create an event for the mouse button release.

If you look in the code, you'll find `mouseReleased`. Let's check if that's working. I'll open the console. At the bottom, you can see "mouseMoved" events happening. Now, let's try `mouseReleased`—we see `mousePressed`, then `mouseReleased`.

We are instructed that when the mouse button is released, we should make `Cryptic_Store_CombA` equal to `16`.

### Coding Tip

Copy the instructions into your code as comments. This makes it much easier to check your work and reduces the need to scroll up and down. It's good coding practice and really helps with error checking.

Now, that's all we have to do: set `Cryptic_Store_CombA` to `16` upon mouse release. Let's refresh the sketch and see what happens. Did you see it? It changes to `16` when I release the button.

Let's do a couple more.

## Mouse Dragged

Set `Cryptic_Store_CombA` to `5` when the mouse is being dragged. Look for `mouseDragged`. Again, I copied and pasted this instruction (just be careful with that). Now, `Cryptic_Store_CombA` equals `5` when the mouse is dragged.

Let's try it: I release the mouse, it goes to `16`. I drag the mouse, and it's `5`. Cool! So we've completed two actions.

## Key Pressed

Let’s do one more: when any key is pressed, set `Cryptic_Store_CombA` to `22`. Go to the key press event in your code.

Now, `Cryptic_Store_CombA` equals `22`. Let's try it out. I'm going to press a key (you can't see me pressing it, but I am). You see it equals `22`. If I press and release the mouse, it's back to `16`. If I drag it, it becomes `5`. Very cool.

## Progress So Far

We've completed several instructions now. Next, I'm going to go back and check my progress. I find the correct sketch and submit the solution.

As you can see, the puzzle is still not solved: we have 37.5 percent complete. We've gotten some things done, but there is more to do. For example, we haven't configured anything for `Cryptic_Store_CombB` yet. There's still a long way to go.

**Now, it's your turn to continue and see how you get on.**
