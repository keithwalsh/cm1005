# Two Methods for Writing Programs

Okay, so we've run some programs, and now it's your turn to start writing your own. In this course, we're going to work with two methods for writing programs:

1. **Writing code from scratch**: Starting with a blank page and building your code from the ground up.
2. **Learning by hacking**: This means playing with and adapting existing code to create something new.

> When coders talk about "hacking," they don't mean breaking into emails or bank accounts. Instead, hacking means tinkering with code—changing, testing, and modifying it to learn how it works. Sometimes, "hacking" can also refer to roughly written code, or code written without a deep understanding, but regardless, hacking is a great way to learn.

## Hacking as an Exploratory Process

Hacking is an exploratory process. At first, you might not understand the code. However, by adapting small parts, you can gradually figure out what it's doing. You might:

- See if you can "break" the program, then try to fix it.
- Study parts of the code that are unclear.
- Look up unknown commands in the [p5.js reference](https://p5js.org/reference/).
- Reflect on unexpected outcomes and try to work out what happened.

## Example: Hacking Sample Code

Let's look at some sample code, ready to hack. Here’s my approach:

### Change the Numbers

The first thing I might try is changing some numbers in the code to see what happens. For example, I have a `triangle` command. If I change one of the numbers (e.g., from 18 to 200), I can see that the triangle shifts across. When I change it back, it returns to its original position—confirming how that number works.

If I change another number, I see a different effect. And sometimes if a change isn't immediately visible in the preview, I just press the refresh button to update it. If a change is very small, it might not make much difference—so it's worth trying a much bigger change to see the effect. For instance, when a triangle's corner goes off the screen, I know my change had a big impact.

### Undoing Mistakes

If you make the program "break" with your modifications, don’t worry. You can always use the Undo function to get back to where you started. That’s totally fine—it's all part of the hacking process!

---

### Commenting Out Code

Another thing I do is comment out lines of code. By putting two slashes (`//`) in front of a line, it goes grey and doesn't run anymore. This helps identify which parts of the code are responsible for which shapes or behaviors. For example, commenting out a line might show that it's responsible for drawing a particular shape like an `ellipse`.

This process helps me understand what different commands do.

### Copying and Modifying Commands

I might also copy some of the commands—like an `ellipse`—and change their numbers to see what effect that has. Making several copies and altering their parameters lets me see multiple ellipses appear. Changing different numbers moves them around and arranges them differently on the screen.

If I try changing other numbers I haven’t experimented with yet, for instance, making a number quite large, then I can see that it changes the width of the ellipse. Changing another number might affect the height. Through this process, I gradually develop an understanding of what each command and parameter does.

# Your Turn

That’s the basic approach to hacking. Now it’s your turn. Have a go at the **Hack the Robot** sketch on the platform!
