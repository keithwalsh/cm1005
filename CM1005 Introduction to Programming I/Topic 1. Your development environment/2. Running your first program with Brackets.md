# Running Your First Sketch with Brackets IO

In this video, I'm going to show you how to run your first sketch and edit it using the Brackets IO editor.

## Downloading and Extracting the Example Sketch

The first thing you need to do is download the example sketch from the Coursera platform. I've already got one here on my laptop. The next step is to extract the file since it's a zip file. If you're on a Mac, just double-click the file and the folder will open. On other platforms, you may need to use a different method, but you will not need to download any extra software to do this.

When you look into the folder, you'll find three files, which I will talk you through now:

- **index.html** — We have this because every p5.js sketch is actually a web page. We'll use this to run our file in a moment.
- **p5.min.js** — This file contains all the library code for p5.js.
- **sketch.js** — This is the only file we'll edit in Introduction to Programming.

The important point is that you need all three files to run your sketch, and they must all stay in the same folder.

## Running Your Sketch

To quickly run your sketch:

1. Locate the `index.html` file.
2. If you're on a Mac, you can right-click (contextual click), choose "Open With," and select your favorite browser such as Chrome, Safari, or Firefox.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your chosen browser.

There you go—you've run the sketch!

## Editing Your Sketch

We will want to edit the `sketch.js` file. You might be tempted to open this file with Word, Notepad, or TextEdit, but this is a bad idea. These programs are not designed for editing code. For editing code, you need a specific code editor.

## Installing Brackets IO

The editor we're going to use is called Brackets IO. Visit [brackets.io](https://brackets.io/) to find it. It's open source and free. Simply download it by clicking the download button. The installation process should be straightforward regardless of your platform.

## Opening Your Sketch in Brackets

After downloading Brackets:

1. Open the Brackets editor.
2. You'll likely see some default files—ignore these for now.
3. Instead of opening an individual file, **open the whole folder** containing the p5.js sketch.

There are two ways to do this:

- **Drag the folder** for your sketch into the sidebar on the left of Brackets. The sketch will open.
- Use the **File** menu, select "Open Folder," and navigate to your p5.js sketch folder (for example, on your desktop), then open it.

When you've done this, you'll see your three files listed. Click on `sketch.js`, as that's the file we'll be editing.

## Running the Sketch in Brackets with Live Preview

There's another way to run your sketch, and that's within the Brackets editor itself. Here's how:

1. Click the **lightning symbol** on the right-hand side of the screen.
2. This opens what's called a **live preview**, which works a little differently from just clicking the `index.html` file.

For example, if you change the background color in your code (we'll learn more about this later), changing it from black to red and saving your changes (using Command + S), you'll see the background color update in the live preview window instantly. You can also try moving shapes by changing the appropriate numbers in your code.

## Common Problems and Troubleshooting

While working through this process, you may encounter a few issues:

### Editing the Wrong File

If you end up editing the wrong file, changes won't show in the live preview. For instance, if you make a copy of your sketch and now have two `sketch.js` files, you might start working on one, but the live preview doesn't update. This happens because you're editing the incorrect file. Always make sure you are editing the right `sketch.js`.

### Opening Files the Wrong Way

If you open only a single file instead of the folder, live preview will not work properly. For example, if you try "Open With Brackets" on just the `sketch.js`, you'll see a live preview error. That's because you didn't open the entire folder with all three files. The correct way is to drag the **whole folder** into Brackets or use "Open Folder" from the File menu.

### Errors in Your Code

If there's an error in your code, such as a typo or a mistake, you'll typically see a blank white screen in the live preview. This usually means something is wrong in your code, and you'll need to fix the error before you can view your sketch. We'll discuss how to fix code errors in a later video in this topic.
