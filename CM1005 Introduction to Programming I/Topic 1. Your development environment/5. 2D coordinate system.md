# Understanding the 2D Coordinate System

In this module, we're going to be making a lot of graphical programs. But before we can do that, we need to understand how the computer screen is organized.

## Pixels and the Canvas

If you look closely at your computer screen, you'll see that it's made up of many tiny points of light called **pixels**. These pixels are arranged in a grid on the computer screen. In p5.js, we create an area of these pixels on the web page that we can draw on. This area is called the **canvas**.

To create a canvas, you need to specify its width and height. In p5.js, you use the `createCanvas` command, which takes two numbers in brackets after the word: the first number is the width of the canvas and the second is the height. Remember, at the end of any command in JavaScript, you need to put a semicolon to indicate the end of the command.

## Counting Pixels and the Coordinate Grid

Imagine that the grid you see on screen is the canvas. Suppose it's 20 pixels by 20 pixels. We’ve enlarged it for illustration, but at actual size, it would be very small—smaller than a file icon and not really usable, but helpful for explanation.

On this grid, the numbers run from 0 to 19. In computing, it's common to start counting from **zero**. This is important to remember.

A handy tip: an "x" makes a cross shape, so the **x coordinate** goes *across* the screen. We always specify coordinates as (x, y)—first the x coordinate (across), then the y coordinate (down). This system is called a **Cartesian coordinate system**, which you may recall from mathematics.

## Pixel Addresses

Let's look at some possible pixel addresses:

- **Top left pixel**: (0, 0) – x is 0 and y is 0.
- **Top right pixel**: (19, 0) – x is 19 and y is 0.
- **Bottom left pixel**: (0, 19) – x is 0 and y is 19 (20 pixels down on y, starting from zero).
- **Bottom right pixel**: (19, 19) – x is 19 and y is 19.

Looking at the center of the screen:
- (9, 9) would be close to the middle, nine across and nine down.
- (17, 3) would be up towards the top right corner.

If you try to go to (7, 21), you’ll be outside the bottom of the screen. p5.js will still try to draw that point—there’s no error—but you won’t see it on your canvas. If something doesn’t appear on screen as expected, it might be drawing outside the canvas area.

## Drawing Shapes: The Rectangle

Drawing single points is interesting, but often we want to draw more practical shapes, like rectangles.

To draw a rectangle, first decide where the **top-left corner** will be. For example, in the image, the top-left corner might be at (5, 3): five pixels across and three down.

Besides the top-left corner, you also need to know the **width** and **height** of the rectangle. If you count across and see the rectangle is 11 pixels wide and 8 pixels high, you have all the information you need to draw it.

## The `rect` Command in p5.js

In p5.js, you use the `rect` command to draw rectangles. The command takes four arguments inside the brackets:

1. The x coordinate of the top-left corner
2. The y coordinate of the top-left corner
3. The width of the rectangle
4. The height of the rectangle

For example, to draw a square with the top-left corner at (100, 100) and both width and height of 200, you would use those numbers as arguments. Let’s try this in a real p5.js sketch.

## Sketch Structure: setup and draw Functions

By now, you’ve probably tried running some applications, but you may not know how the code is organized. There are two main functions in the basic template:

- `setup` – This is where you create your canvas.
- `draw` – This is where you put your drawing commands.

We’ll learn more about functions later, but for now, just remember where to put your code.

Let’s create a canvas: make it 500 by 500 pixels. This will take up about a quarter of the screen—big enough to be useful, but not too big or small.

## Drawing Rectangles on the Canvas

Now, let’s put a rectangle on this canvas. Use the `rect` command and place it at (100, 100), making it a square 100 pixels wide and 100 pixels high. Save your code, and run the live preview by pressing the button at the top. This will launch your browser, and you should see your first piece of p5.js drawing code at work: a simple square on the canvas.

Next, let’s add a second square to the right of the first one. The first square is at (100, 100). To position the next one, go 100 pixels across for the width of the first square, plus another 50 pixels—so 250 across. Keep the y-coordinate the same at 100, and use the same width and height as before. Save your code again. The live preview will automatically update and now you’ll see two squares sitting nicely next to each other.
