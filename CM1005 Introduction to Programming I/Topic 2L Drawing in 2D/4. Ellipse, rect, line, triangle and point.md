# Exploring New Shapes in p5.js

Hopefully by now you are completely bored with drawing rectangles. So in this video, we're going to look at some different shapes. I have a sketch here which you can download right below this video. If you run it with live preview, you should be able to see some circles, an ellipse, a line, and a triangle. 

We will skip over the rectangle for now—hopefully you are comfortable with how that works. Let's look at some of the new shapes you can draw.

## Ellipse

The `ellipse` command is made up of four parts, just like the rectangle command. However, rather than the x and y coordinate representing the top-left corner, here they specify the center of the circle. That provides us with the x and the y.

The width and the height are the same: they represent the total diameter. For a circle, those two values will be the same. If you change the height of the ellipse, it will become squished and oblique; if you change the width, it will become long and thin or tall.

If we look at this in code, you can see I have two ellipses. The first one is a circle, with equal width and height, drawing a circle in the bottom left. The second is an ellipse, which is stretched lengthwise with a longer width than height.

## Line

Our next shape is the line. The `line` command is used to draw a line and it has four arguments: two pairs of x and y coordinates. The first pair, x1 and y1, are for one end of the line; the second pair, x2 and y2, are for the other end.

It doesn't matter which coordinates you use for the ends—the line will always be drawn between those two points.

Returning to the code, let's look at the line command. Here, both x-coordinates (x1 = 250, x2 = 250) are the same. That means both points are aligned vertically, giving us a vertical line down the screen.

If we change the values to (50, 250) and (450, 250), and save, we get a horizontal line across the center of the screen, as the y-coordinates are the same. To make the line diagonal, do not match the x and y-coordinates, and the symmetry is broken.

## Triangle

The final shape for today is the triangle. The triangle is made up of three pairs of coordinates—one for each corner. The first pair is x1, y1; the second is x2, y2; and finally x3, y3.

A great thing about triangles is that it doesn't matter which order you put the coordinates in: you can cycle them around and still get the same triangle. This means you can draw any type of triangle you want, whether that's a right-angle triangle or an irregular one.

In the code, the triangle command is used with six arguments for the three pairs of coordinates.

## Point and Stroke Weight

There's one last shape on this sketch: the point. You may not be able to see the point at first, but it is there. To make it visible, p5.js provides the `strokeWeight` command. 

Before drawing the point, set the stroke weight using `strokeWeight` and enter a value in pixels—say, five. This increases the size of the point, making it visible.

After doing this, you'll notice the point appears nice and big, but the other shapes also have their stroke weights increased. This is probably not what you want. To fix this, after the point command, set `strokeWeight(1)` to change it back.

You might wonder: if the point is last in the `draw` function, why is everything being drawn with the heavier stroke weight? That's because `draw` runs repeatedly, and p5.js retains the current stroke weight setting. So even if you set the stroke weight back to one at the end of `draw`, the next time `draw` runs, the commands for the rectangle and other shapes use the most recent stroke weight.

## Experiment with Shapes

Now go ahead and have a play with these different shapes. Change some of the values and try drawing your own designs!
