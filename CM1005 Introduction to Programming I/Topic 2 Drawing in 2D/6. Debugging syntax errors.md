# Debugging Syntax Errors

We all make mistakes and coders are no exception. When coders make mistakes, they call them *bugs*, and as long as there has been coding, there have been bugs. This is an image of perhaps the first computer bug recorded by computer pioneer, Grace Hopper. The source of an error in an electromechanical computer was found to be a moth that had become trapped in its workings—so it was a bug in both senses of the word.

Now, in the last video, we used the console to identify and fix a bug. This process is called **debugging**.

Debugging is a core skill of programming, which takes time to master. We're going to cover some of the basics now, but it's a topic which we'll keep returning to in this course. In this video, we’re going to look at two types of bugs: **syntax errors** and **argument errors**.

---

## Syntax Errors

The first is called a *syntax error*. It's essentially a typo, the simplest type of error you can make, but there are still many types of syntax error.

### Example: Missing Bracket

I have an example here: although there's lots of drawing code, it's producing a blank white screen. So we know there is probably an error here.

The first thing I'm going to do is open the console. Sure enough, when I look there, I can see an error:

> SyntaxError: missing bracket after argument list.

We also see some really useful information: the line number this error is on. In this case, line 11. If we scroll down to line 11, we can see that there is a missing bracket after the `background` command. If I just insert that and save the file, the error is fixed.

### Example: Commenting Mistake

Now, let's look at a different type of syntax error. Again, we see a blank white screen. The code clearly isn't working. What is wrong with the code this time?

I open the console. This time we get a different message:

> SyntaxError: unexpected identifier.

Looking at the message, it's referencing line 20. On line 20, I see I've typed `overlapping shapes`. What was supposed to happen here is that this was supposed to be a comment, but I forgot to put the double slashes `//` in front. I add those now, save the file, and the error is fixed.

### Example: Reference Error - Incorrect Casing

Let's look at another example. Once again, a blank white screen: the code isn't working, and I open the console. The message now is:

> Uncaught ReferenceError: createcanvas is not defined

This happens on line 3. This is strange because we know that `createCanvas` is a command we've used before. In this case, the mistake is a common one: I forgot to use camel case—specifically, the capital 'C' for Canvas. Once I fix the casing, the code works.

### Example: Misleading Error Message

Here's one more syntax error. We get the blank white screen and, when I check the console, it says:

> missing bracket after argument list

This time, it's on line 13. Looking closely at line 13, there *isn't* a missing bracket. Here we see the limitations of the console—the console can't always accurately tell us what the problem is. We have to use some deduction.

In this case, the bracket isn’t missing. Something else is wrong. On careful inspection, I notice that I’ve forgotten to put a comma in the list of arguments, and that's causing the problem. I add the comma, save the file, and the bug is fixed.

## Argument Errors

Now, let's look at a different type of error. For want of a better word, I’ll call this an *argument error*. This means we're not providing the right information that a command requires.

### Example: Missing Argument

Let’s run this example. Here, we can see some of the drawings worked, but some haven't. The program isn’t responding as expected.

Looking at the console, we don’t see any particular error to look up—just an unrelated favicon error. So we need to deduce what is wrong.

I was expecting to see a rectangle, but I can't. Looking at the rectangle command on line 11, I see the problem straight away: I only provided three arguments, but the rectangle function needs four. So, I add the extra argument for the height of the rectangle. The problem is fixed.

### Example: Incorrect Argument Type

Another example: again, the drawing hasn’t worked as expected, indicating that something is wrong. I see a strange, oversized rectangle. Checking the console just shows the irrelevant favicon error, so the console isn’t helping this time.

Examining the `ellipse` command, I quickly spot the issue. In this case, ellipses expect numbers, but instead of putting in numbers, I accidentally put in text surrounded by quotation marks. This stops the ellipse command from working correctly.

To fix this, I delete each of the quotation marks, and the problem should be resolved. And there we have it—problem solved.

Now, we've only covered a fraction of the types of errors you might encounter. This is just the start of debugging. What I would do now is try the debug challenge that follows this video.
