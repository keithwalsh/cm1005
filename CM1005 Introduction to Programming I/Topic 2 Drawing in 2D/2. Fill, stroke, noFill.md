# Changing Colors of Shapes

Now that we've learned how to control colors, let's change the colors of the shapes we draw. There are four commands to do this: **fill**, **noFill**, **stroke**, and **noStroke**.

---

## Using `fill`

I'm going to start by showing you how `fill` works. Imagine a sketch that draws some shapes on the canvas; initially, they are all black. The `fill` command changes the inside color of these shapes.

Let's use `fill` in the `setup` function. For example, setting fill to a red color with the values 255, 0, 0:

- You can see that `fill` takes the same arguments as the `background` command.
- After this, the shapes on the canvas become red.
- I'll try a few more colors to show the difference: first yellow, and then blue.

---

## Removing the Fill

It's also possible to make shapes that aren't filled at all. Watch the shapes at the bottom and notice the difference:

- First, I set the fill to white.
- Next, I remove the fill by replacing the command with `noFill`.
- The `noFill` command does not take any arguments.
- Now, the shapes are transparent because nothing is filling the inside of them.
- If I change the background color, this effect becomes even more obvious.

---

## Controlling the Outline with `stroke`

The next step is to control the colors of the outlines of shapes. For this, we use the `stroke` command.

- The `stroke` command works just like `fill`. I type `stroke` and then three values: R, G, and B.
- First, I set the outline to red.
- For variety, I change it to blue and observe the difference.

Sometimes, you might want shapes with no outline at all:

- Instead of setting `stroke`, use `noStroke`.
- The `noStroke` command also takes no arguments.
- For reference, I set the shapes back to yellow.
- Now, the shapes appear yellow but have no outline.

## Setting Different Colors for Different Shapes

You might want each shape to have its own color. To do this, move the color commands (like `fill`) from the `setup` function into the `draw` function.

- For example, I set the first rectangle to yellow by typing `fill` just before drawing it.
- At first, everything is yellow, but if I want the other shapes to be red, I call `fill` again with red just after the first rectangle.
- Think of `fill` as a paintbrush: the program can only "hold" one color at a time. Every time I call `fill`, it changes what color is used for all subsequent drawing until changed again.

---

## A Common Problem: Color Updates in `draw`

You might start by setting the fill color to yellow in the `setup` function, expecting your rectangle to be yellow and the other shapes to be red. What really happens?

- All the shapes end up red.
- The problem is that `setup` runs only once, but `draw` runs repeatedly.
- At first, the rectangle was briefly yellow, but on the next frame, the fill changed to red and all further shapes became red.
- A good practice: always set your color at the beginning of the `draw` function.

---

## Adding Outlines

You may want to add different outlines to your shapes:

- Set the outline to green for one shape, then to blue for another.
- A similar problem can occur as before: if the draw loop is repeated and you haven't set `noStroke`, your yellow rectangle might end up with a blue outline.
- To prevent this, use `noStroke` at the start of your `draw` function if you don't want an outline on the rectangle.

---

## Transparency and Alpha Value

Another thing to experiment with is transparency, or the alpha value.

- To set transparency, add a fourth argument to the `fill` command.
- For example, set the color to red, and the fourth value to 255 for full opacity.
- If you change this value to 0, the shape becomes fully transparent.
- Put it somewhere in between, like 100, and you'll see a semi-transparent effect.
- This can create attractive overlays where colors blend and appear darker.

## Try It Yourself

That's everything you need to know about `fill` and `stroke`. Experiment with these commands in your sketch, and don't forget to try the Hackett exercise, Robot Parade.
