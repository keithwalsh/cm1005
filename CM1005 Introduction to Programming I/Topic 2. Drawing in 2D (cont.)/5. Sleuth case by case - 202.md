# Getting Started with Case 202: The Case of Bob and Daisy

In this video, I'm going to show you how to get started with case 202, the case of Bob and Daisy. Let's go straight to it: download the crime and unzip the crime. By now, you should know the drill. Next, I'll get Brackets open and drag that folder in. Now, let's take a look at the crime.

The case of Bob and Daisy involves a pair of notorious criminals, Woz and Jobs, who are at it again, sending letters to each other. On the surface, these letters look like love lessons from the characters called Bob and Daisy, but actually, there's a hidden code.

## Finding the Hidden Code

Reading the instructions, it is revealed that *the hidden code is in red text only*. Let's look at the sketch and see what this means. Here we see a lovely love letter:

> "Oh, lovely Daisy. You are my sunny day in April. From the first moment I saw your lovely face, I knew that from those few seconds, you are my one true love."

It all sounds beautiful, except that there is, in fact, a dastardly hidden code here—and it's in the red letters. We see "April, something something something." The goal is to get the sketch so that only the red text appears, and we'll do that by commenting.

We've been told to comment out lines carefully. Specifically, we must comment out all the text commands that are *not* for red text. The **fill** commands are to remain; only non-red text commands should be commented out.

## Identifying the Color Red

First, let's remind ourselves what the color red is. The color red is represented by `255,0,0`. So, any fill commands with that mixture are red. Green (for example, `0,255,0`) and black are not red. When you see a fill with `255,0,0`, keep it—these are the ones you have to allow. All others will need to be commented.

## An Efficient Commenting Method

You could go through line by line, commenting each one, but I'm going to show you a quicker way. I'll do something a bit counter-intuitive: select *all* the commands and apply comments to all of them. This can be done by going to the Edit menu and toggling the line comment, or by using the hotkey. Now, everything is commented.

That's great. Next, you need to look for the fill commands that use red, and uncomment the text commands immediately underneath those. I'll use the search tool for this.

## Using Search to Find Red Text

Search for `fill 255,0,0` because that's the color red. Here we go; we can see the first bits of red text to uncomment. Only go down to the next fill command, because then the color changes. Let's find the next bits. There are actually three to find here, so this becomes much easier once you start using the tool.

One more to go, which is "April." If I look at my output now, I can see the hidden code: "April 2nd, a chosen date." This is when something is supposed to happen—April second.

## Ensuring the Fill Commands Remain

Looking back at the instructions, it also states that the fill commands themselves should be left uncommented. I haven't fully finished the job yet, but I can use Find and Replace to help. Find all the commented-out fill commands and replace them with just the fill command (uncommented).

Sometimes tabs and spacing can get a bit out of place. If I had more time, I would fix those details, but for now, let's check: can I still see my secret message? Yes, I can!

## Submitting the Solution

Finally, I'm going to try and mark this one. I select the sketch and submit the solution: 100 percent! We've correctly decoded the message and received a message from Achieved: "Great web kit." 

Okay, now it's your turn.
