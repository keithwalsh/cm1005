# Introduction

Hello again, and congratulations for making it this far in the course. Now, this is my favorite part: you are about to start work on the main assignment for this course—and guess what that is? It's a game project! As a game designer myself, I can't be any happier for you to start developing games. In my opinion, making games is the most amazing thing. Game creation is collaboration, it's problem solving, it's creativity, and do you know the best part? When you see other people playing your game and reacting to it, it's just amazing.

## Project Structure and Overview

For the remaining weeks of this course, you will be developing a game from scratch using the P5 JS library. You will submit the game in two parts:

- **Part 1**: The initial version of the game with some features, which forms your midterm assignment (halfway through the course).
- **Part 2**: The finished version of the game, which is the game project, at the end of the module.

Now, let's look at the overview for this lecture. We are going to cover two main things:

1. A recap of everything you've been doing in this course so far (essentially, the first three weeks).
2. An introduction to the Game Project Part 1.

This is the initial version of your game that you will be submitting as part of the midterm coursework. We'll take a look at some background information, what you need to make, some information about assessment, and I'll also give you some tips on how to do well with the game project.

# Course Recap

## Week 1

In Week 1, you've learned about coding editors. You've learned about Brackets (that’s one of them), and we've also introduced you to a more modern coding editor called Visual Studio Code. You’ve learned about the P5.JS library—which is the library that you will be using to develop the game project.

As part of Week 1, you've also learned about the 2D coordinate system within the P5.JS library. If you remember well, it's essentially the same as the Cartesian coordinate system, except that the Y axis is flipped.

## Week 2

In Week 2, we introduced you to Sleuth. If you haven't completed all the cases in the 101 series, please do so. I can’t emphasize enough how important it is for you to complete all the Sleuth cases. Sleuth really teaches you core fundamentals of programming, which are essential if you want to become a proficient programmer. They will also help you do better in the game project. Please, if you haven't finished all of them, go back and complete all the cases in the 101 series.

## Week 3

Finally, in Week 3, you've learned more about program flow. You’ve learned a bit more about the P5.JS library, including its two main functions. Remember the `setup` function, which executes your code only once, and the `draw` function, which executes your code multiple times, almost like in a loop. You've learned about drawing shapes and some functions to draw basic shapes, and you've also learned a bit about how to debug your code using the console to spot mistakes.

# Introduction to the Game Project Part 1

## Background Information

What do you need to make for this project? You are required to produce a **2D side-scrolling video game**.

I'm sure you know what a 2D side-scrolling video game is, but in case you don't, here are some examples: Mario, Sonic, maybe you've heard of others like Meta’s Lag or Rayman. A 2D side-scrolling video game is a two-dimensional game where the player or main character is normally sitting in the middle of the screen and can move left or right, while the camera follows the player.

There is also a link to a "hall of fame", which is a collection of previous work done by students in this course. You can take a look at examples of games produced in previous sessions. Actually, let’s take a look at one of them together.

I'm in the hall of fame—a game project website—and you can see a collection of games that students have made in previous sessions. I think what we should do is play one. Why not? I'm going to click on the very first one.

This was made in 2019. Use the arrow keys to move and space to jump. You can see that it's 2D: there’s a character who can move left and right, and can also jump. On the top left-hand side, I see there are lives—probably three. There’s also a TNT icon, which I believe I need to collect. Let’s collect one of them. That’s it!

Yes, I’ve just collected one. Now let's go right and collect another. This is probably an enemy—so I’ll jump over him. I've reached an end: it says I need at least five dynamites to proceed, so I guess I need to go left and collect some more. I’ll go left, avoid the enemy, and keep going. There’s another TNT—and another enemy. I need to time my jump—and I did it. One more: that was a big jump—and I fell!

Let's try again—one, two, jump over the enemy, and I fell again. I might be a game designer, but I’m not as good at playing! But this gives you a sense of what we ask you to produce for this module.

**Bear in mind:** this example is a finished version of the game, not the Part 1 version you need to submit for the midterm.

# Requirements and Assessment

Back to the slides—now we've seen an example of a previous student's game, and it was amazing. Feel free to play as many games as you want, because playing games might inspire your game project.

For Game Project Part 1, we are concentrating on two things:
1. **Interaction**
2. **Scrolling**

For the first part of the game, we are only asking you to draw basic functions for the background scenery—set up the scenery for the game. This can be the grass, the sky, maybe some trees in the background. Just set up the background.

You will also need to include a game character. You have to draw a player (a game character) and make it move. You’ll deal with interactions, moving the character left and right, and perhaps making it jump (which you can achieve with conditionals).

Then we will look at interaction with the game character and the world—collecting items, for example, or checking for collision. Remember when I fell earlier on while playing the game? That is also a collision.

So, you will learn how to make the game character interact with various elements within the game. Finally, you will implement the scrolling feature—essentially, having the camera follow the player as they move.

That’s an introduction to what you need to do for Game Project Part 1.

## Assessment Details

For the midterm coursework, you will submit the Game Project Part 1. The submission page is available in Week 10, but you will notice it’s not open yet. The coursework specification will be released to you a month in advance (about halfway through the course). It’s not available yet, but we will release it in time—giving you plenty of time to read the specifications and develop your project.

The module leader will also host a midterm webinar—a live event—which you should attend, as you can ask live questions about the midterm and Game Project Part 1.

As for the grading: the midterm coursework is **worth 50% of the marks** for the course. This includes Game Project Part 1 and perhaps another activity (you will get the full specifications in time, one month before the submission deadline).

# Tips for Success

Some tips—because tips are always helpful!

1. **Watch and Implement All Code-Along Lectures**  
   From now until the midterm submission point, the instructors will do code-along lectures, where parts of the game are implemented. Please make sure you watch all of them and also code along and implement the game as you go. This is very important.

2. **Engage with Sleuth**  
   As I’ve said before, make sure you complete all Sleuth cases. It's super important for you to really understand the core aspects of programming. This will help you do better in the game project, and who knows—we might ask you to discuss some of those cases as part of your midterm coursework. Please do all of them.

3. **Have Fun!**  
   The final and most important point: please have fun. Making games is all about fun. Enjoy making your game project!

# Conclusion

In this lecture, we've learned about Game Project Part 1: the background information, the requirements, the assessments, and I’ve given you some tips on how to do well in this first part of your project.

With that being said—best of luck! I'm looking forward to seeing what you submit for the first part of your project. Have fun, and make great games.
