# Sleuth Puzzle: Case 201 – Judge Hopper

In this video, we are going to work through another sleuth puzzle. If you haven't already, open up the sleuth app and click **"Let solve some crimes."** We're going to be doing **case 201**, the case of Judge Hopper.

## Getting Started

To begin, click **"Department of Justice"** and then **"download crime."** The file will appear in your downloads folder. You just need to extract it and open it up in Brackets.

## Setting the Scene

Judge Hopper has gone missing and we have been booked to investigate. Our task is to draw a separate ellipse around four pieces of evidence:

- Letter opener
- Death threat letters
- Telephone
- AGOL leaflets

If you look at the `scene.PNG`, you will see Judge Hopper's office with the four pieces of evidence on his desk. 

If you run the scene in your browser, Judge Hopper's desk should appear as it does in the PNG file.

## Drawing Ellipses

To draw ellipses, we use the `ellipse` function. Remember, we need four pieces of information as arguments:

- The x-coordinate of the center
- The y-coordinate of the center
- The width 
- The height

### Finding Ellipse Coordinates

#### AGOL Letters

Start by locating the AGOL letters in `scene.PNG`.  
The center point is roughly at **(264, 358)**.  
Set those values as the center coordinates. Start with a width and height of 100 pixels. This is a little tight, so increase the size to 130 pixels.

Now there is an ellipse around that piece of evidence.

#### Letter Opener

Next, locate the letter opener in `scene.PNG`.  
The center is about **(254, 236)**.  
This needs to be more narrow and long, so adjust the width and height appropriately. Try the coordinates and size; that looks good.

#### Death Threat Letters

Now look at the death threat letters.  
The center is around **(415, 292)**.  
Begin with 100 by 100. If it appears too tight, increase both the width and height to 140.

That looks good for the death threat letters.

#### Telephone

Lastly, move to the telephone in `scene.PNG`.  
The center is **(717, 240)**—don't forget to include the handle!  
This ellipse should be quite wide, so try 200 by 100. If the handle is being cut off, increase the height to 150.

## Submitting the Solution

Once all the ellipses are drawn, upload your work. 

- Browse to the sketch file, **Sketch.js**
- Open and submit your solution

You should now have solved the puzzle and received full marks!
