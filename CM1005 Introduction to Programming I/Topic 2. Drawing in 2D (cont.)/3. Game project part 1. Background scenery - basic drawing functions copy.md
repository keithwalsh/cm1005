# Getting Started with the Game Project Assessment

Let's take a look at the first of our game project assessments.

If you download the link next to this video, you will get a zip file that looks like the one in my downloads folder. Double-click to extract it, and then drag and drop the whole folder into Brackets. If you're not quite sure how to do this, or you've forgotten, please check our video from the previous topic.

Inside the folder, you'll find a sketch file, where you will do your coding. There are already some points identified where you'll need to add extra items. There's also a README file that will explain what you need to do for the exercise.

Let's go back to the sketch and run the file.

## Running the Sketch

Click the lightning bolt. You'll see a nice blue sky and green ground, which, in a few weeks, will be the space for our characters to run on. To start with, we are just going to add some basic background scenery for our game.

In the output of the sketch, you can see various labels for things we need to draw and where they should be placed: a cloud, a mountain, a canyon, a collectible item, and a tree.

In this video, I’ll show you how to draw a couple of these objects to get started. The rest will be up to you!

# Drawing the Cloud

We’ll start by drawing the cloud using three ellipses.

You should keep these fairly simple to start with. You can make your cloud more elaborate later, adjusting its parameters and appearance as you like.

### Placing the Cloud

If you look at the text being drawn in the sketch, it shows the label "cloud" and also the x and y coordinates for where that text is placed. We want to put our cloud near that spot.

I suggest drawing it just beneath the label. Use the same x coordinate of 200, and use a slightly lower y coordinate, such as 150. To begin, make the ellipse 80 pixels by 80 pixels (a circle). Save and run it. The ellipse will appear, but it's the wrong color.

Before drawing the ellipse, call the `fill` function with `255, 255, 255` to make it white. Save and run again to see the white cloud.

---

### Shaping the Cloud

Make the cloud look more authentic by adding another ellipse slightly to the left of the first one. Set this ellipse at x = 160, y = 150, and make it 60 by 60. This adds an ellipse to the left.

Next, add an ellipse to the right. Do a little math to make it symmetrical: if the left ellipse is 40 pixels left of the center (at x = 160), the right one should be 40 pixels right (at x = 240). Make this one 60 by 60 as well. Save and run the sketch.

Now you have a nice, fluffy cloud! You can move it around, change its shape, elongate the ellipses, and make it your own.

# Drawing the Mountain

The next item for you to draw is a mountain. This one is up to you!

You’ll probably want to set a grey fill color and draw a triangle shape for your mountain.

---

# Drawing the Tree

The tree is a little more tricky, so I’ll demonstrate how to draw it.

## Drawing the Trunk

First, draw a rectangle for the trunk. If you look at the relevant text command, it uses x = 800 for placement, but let's move the trunk slightly to the right by using x = 900.

For the y coordinate, we need the top-left corner of our rectangle. The bottom of the rectangle should sit on the same level as the floor, which is at y = 432. Since we want the trunk to be 150 pixels tall, subtract 150 from 432, which gives 282 for the top of the rectangle. Set the width to 60 and height to 150.

This should draw the trunk sitting on the ground. Check how it looks – it may be the wrong color.

To fix this, set the fill color to a nice brown shade. You can adjust the shade as you like.

---

## Drawing the Branches

After drawing the trunk, let's add some branches using two triangles stacked on top of each other.

Add a comment to your code to mark that this section is for branches. Set the fill to green, matching the ground: `fill(0, 155, 0)`. Then draw the triangles.

### First Triangle (Lower Branches)
- The first point (bottom left) should be slightly to the left of the trunk: x = 850.
- The y coordinate for this point is a bit above the ground, say y = 332.
- The second point (top of the tree) should be in the middle of the trunk: trunk starts at x = 900 and is 60 wide, so the middle is x = 930. For the y coordinate, pick a value above the base, such as y = 232.
- The third point (bottom right) has the same y-coordinate as the first (y = 332), and x is 80 pixels to the other side of the peak: 930 + 80 = 1010.

### Second Triangle (Upper Branches)
- Use the same x coordinates, but higher up the tree.
- The left base point: y = 282 (50 pixels higher).
- The peak: y = 182 (another 50 pixels higher).
- The right base point: y = 282 again.

Save and run to see your tree shape.

# Next Steps

That’s how you get started with Game Project Part 1! Now, you can add a mountain, a canyon, and a collectible item yourself.

Good luck, and have fun drawing your background scenery!
