# Introduction to Variables

In this video, we're going to introduce the concept of variables. So far, we have drawn our shapes using absolute values—fixed numbers that don't change. While this approach works for simple drawings, we now want to start adding animations and interactions to our program. We don't necessarily know what these values will be before the program runs. For example, consider the position of the mouse cursor on the screen.

p5.js provides us with built-in placeholders, known as variables, that we can use in our code. When the program runs, these placeholders are substituted with the actual values.

## Using `mouseX` and `mouseY`

For tracking the cursor, p5.js offers the variables `mouseX` and `mouseY`. 

- `mouseX` provides the mouse's x-coordinate across the canvas.
- `mouseY` gives the y-coordinate (how far down the canvas the cursor is).

Let's look at an example of using `mouseX` and `mouseY` in code. If you download the sketch beneath this video and run it, you should see a black background with a white ellipse in the center. 

What we want to do is change this so that the circle follows our mouse around the screen. If you change the x-coordinate to `mouseX` (written with a lowercase "m" and an uppercase "X") and the y-coordinate to `mouseY`, then save and preview the sketch, you will see the little white spot now follows the mouse cursor.

## Clearing the Background Each Frame

One thing to notice in this sketch: every frame, we redraw the background and set it to `0, 0, 0` (black). 

If this line wasn't present, or if it was placed inside the `setup` function instead of `draw`, you might think that's fine since the background is set initially and doesn't need to change. However, if you save and run the code, you'll actually see different behavior—not what we want. 

This happens because drawing the background each frame effectively "clears" the screen between redraws. Without this, shapes and lines would keep layering on top of one another.

## What are Variables?

These placeholders, like `mouseX` and `mouseY`, are called variables. They act as areas in the computer's memory that save and store information. Whenever we use a variable like `mouseX`, p5.js replaces it with the actual value at that moment.

---

## The `width` and `height` Variables

Let's return to our original template and explore another pair of useful variables p5.js provides: `width` and `height`.

Sometimes, it may be useful to know exactly what the width and height of the canvas are. For example, instead of making a shape that's always 100 by 100 pixels, you might want it to fill the whole canvas. If you change the value `100` to `width`, and the second value to `height`, p5.js will replace these placeholders with the current size of the canvas (for example, 600 by 600).

When you click "Save," you'll now have a circle taking up the entire canvas area. If you change the canvas size to 800 by 800 and set the center point to 400 by 400, you can see the shape still perfectly fits without needing to change the width and height values directly.

---

## Arithmetic with Variables

You can make this even better using arithmetic. For instance, if you change the position to `width / 2` and `height / 2`, you're using the division operator (`/`) in your program. This means you're dividing the width by two and the height by two, which centers the shape on the canvas.

When you rerun the sketch, the circle remains in the same central position, no matter the canvas size. If you restore the canvas size to 600 and save, the circle still sits perfectly centered and fills the entire screen.

---

## Conclusion

We've seen how to use the `mouseX` and `mouseY` variables as placeholders for the cursor and the `width` and `height` variables for the canvas size. The real power of variables comes in when we start to create our own.
