# Mathematical Functions in p5.js

## Introduction

The commands we've been working with so far are related to drawing—they either draw items to the canvas or change some aspect of the program’s state that relates to drawing. For example, the `field` command changes the field color. 

Now, we are going to look at a different set of functions that deal primarily with numbers. These are called **mathematical functions**. In the p5.js reference page, you can find these under the heading "Math." The first of these functions that we’ll examine is `random`.

---

## Using the `random` Function

Let’s start with an empty example, which you can download from the Coursera page. The first thing to do is try the `random` command inside the `setup` function.

If you run this and look at the output, you won’t see anything. This is because `random` is a different type of function from the drawing commands—it does not draw anything on the canvas. Instead, it **returns a number**.

To see the number it returns, use `console.log`. For instance, wrap the `random` function inside `console.log(random())`. When you look at the console, you will see a random decimal number between 0 and 1.

Every time you refresh the page, you’ll get a different number. Your value will likely be different from others, since it really is random!

### Drawing with Random Values

Let’s make things a bit more interesting by using `random` to draw an ellipse.

Suppose you draw an ellipse at the center of the page. If you set its width and height to random values using the `random` function, you’ll notice the ellipse is very small. Remember, `random()` produces values between 0 and 1, which are much too small for sizing an ellipse.

To address this, multiply the output of `random()` by a larger number—say, 250. Now, the ellipse will have a random width and a random height each time you refresh the page.

You can take this even further by placing the code inside the `draw` function instead of `setup`. The `draw` function runs repeatedly, which will make your ellipse "strobe" with different sizes each frame.

---

#### Creating Circles with Random Sizes

If you want the ellipse to have the same random value for both width and height (so it appears as a circle), first assign the result of `random()` to a variable, such as `r`. Then, use `r` for both the width and the height of the ellipse. Each frame, the circle will have a random diameter.

Another useful feature: you can provide two parameters to `random(min, max)`. The first number is the minimum, and the second is the maximum. For example, use `random(50, 250)` to get a value somewhere between 50 and 250. This means you no longer need to multiply after the fact—just use the returned value directly for the size of your shape.

---

## The `min` and `max` Functions

Another mathematical function is `min`, which has an accompanying function called `max`. Let’s explore how they work.

### Using `min`

Just like before, use `console.log(min(0, 1))` and observe the output. The function returns the smallest of the numbers given—so in this case, it outputs 0. If you try `min(10, 1)`, the output will be 1. If you try `min(24, 11000)`, the output will be 24.

In summary, `min` simply takes the lowest value from the inputs provided.

You may be wondering why this is useful. It becomes very handy when dealing with values that change during the runtime of your program, such as `mouseX` and `mouseY`.

#### Example: Limiting Movement with `min`

Suppose you draw an ellipse that follows the mouse:

- Use `ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 50, 50)` to have the ellipse follow the mouse directly.

If you want to stop the ellipse from moving past the middle of the canvas, assign `mouseX` to a variable `x`, and then set `x = min(mouseX, 250)`. Now, the ellipse’s x-coordinate will never go beyond 250. If `mouseX` is greater than 250, `x` will remain 250 and your ellipse will stop at that boundary.

##### Animation Example

Another use: initialize `x` at 0, and increment it by 1 every frame with `x = x + 1`. If you want the movement to stop at 250, use `x = min(x + 1, 250)`. The ellipse will move across the canvas and stop at the point where `x` reaches 250.

---

### Using `max`

The `max` function works in the opposite way to `min`: it returns the larger number.

Suppose you want to animate an ellipse moving from right to left. Set `x` to 500 and decrement by 1 every frame: `x = x - 1`.

If you want the ellipse to stop when it reaches position 250, use `x = max(x - 1, 250)`. Now, the ellipse will move to the left and stop at 250. Using `min` in this context would result in a strange jumping effect, so `max` is more appropriate for this direction of movement.

---

## Other Useful Math Functions

There are other mathematical functions in p5.js that are very useful:

- `constrain` — constrains a value between a minimum and maximum, helpful for limiting variables.
- `map` — maps a number from one range to another.
- `round` and `floor` — used for rounding values, and will become useful as you progress.

Explore these functions and try them out in your own code! Next, proceed to the "Hack It" exercise where you can put these functions to use.
