## 12 Top Tips for Naming Variables

Naming variables might seem like a trivial or simple task, but there are many pitfalls for the novice coder. Here are my 12 top tips for getting it right:

### 1. Avoid Keywords

P5 (and most programming environments) need keywords to run. Using keywords as variable names will cause errors or unexpected behaviour.

### 2. Avoid Weird Symbols

Even if your code works in your browser, using unusual symbols in variable names may break your code on other people's systems.

### 3. Avoid Long Variable Names

You'll need to type variable names over and over again, so keep them short but meaningful.

### 4. Avoid Joke Names

If you can no longer read your code, the joke will be on you! Stick to clear and descriptive names instead.

### 5. Avoid Abstract Names

Variable names should describe what the variable is for. For example, if you're storing a position, use a name like `position` or `pos`.

### 6. Use Camel Casing

Camel casing makes multi-word variable names easier to read. Each new word should start with a capital letter (e.g., `userScore`).

### 7. Use Underscoring

Underscoring is another way to make multi-word variable names more readable (e.g., `user_score`).

### 8. Combine Both Methods

You can combine camel casing and underscoring to organise your variables clearly. Find a method that works best for you and your team.

### 9. Be Consistent

Come up with a naming system and stick to it throughout your codebase.

### 10. Use Objects

When you find yourself declaring many variables to describe a single entity, consider replacing them with an object. This can make your code more organised and easier to maintain.

### 11. Adapt Your Variables

When you start writing a program, it's unlikely you will know exactly what variables will be needed. Don't be afraid to change your variable names as your code develops.

### 12. Use Find and Replace

When you need to update variable names, use the Find and Replace feature in your code editor. It's easier and more accurate than typing manually.
