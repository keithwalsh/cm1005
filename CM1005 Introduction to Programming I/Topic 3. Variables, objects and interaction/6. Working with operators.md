# Working with Variables and Operators

## Static Versus Dynamic Variables

So far, we've stored values in variables and objects. However, these values have remained static while the program is running. If we wanted something to change, we had to manually alter the code.

In this section, we will explore how to change variable values while the program is running, and how this can be used to animate things on our screens.

## JavaScript as a Calculator

You might have realized by now that, among other things, JavaScript functions like a calculator. We can perform any arithmetic operations we want. 

Let's look at the `text` command for displaying output. If you haven’t used the `text` command before, it works by taking three arguments: the first argument is what we want to print to the screen, and the second and third are the x and y positions.

If we replace the text with an expression like `2 + 2`, it won't print "`2 + 2`" to the screen, but rather the result, which is `4`.

Let's try some more examples:

- For `5 - 2`, the answer displayed is `3`.
- For multiplication like `2 * 2`, we get `4`.
- For division with large numbers, we get decimal outputs.

What we've been calling arithmetic, programmers usually refer to as operators—the symbols that perform calculation.

## Using Operators and Variables for Drawing

In our previous sketches, we combined operators and variables to draw on the screen. For example, consider a variable like `yPos`. You could use `yPos` to draw an ellipse. Then, by using arithmetic, we could draw another ellipse relative to the first, like 20 pixels further down.

By continuing this process, we can produce a column of ellipses. However, there's an important detail: the value of `yPos` never actually changes in this method. If we print `yPos` to the screen after running this code, we see it starts and ends at `120`. The calculations using operators are not changing the value in the variable.

## Changing Variable Values with the Assignment Operator

To actually change the value, we need to use the assignment operator, which you may be familiar with as `equals`. 

Let’s adjust the code so `yPos` actually changes. Instead of multiple different commands, we just repeat the assignment for `yPos`:

- Set `yPos = 120 + 20` and we get an ellipse further down.
- Set `yPos = 120 + 40` for another.
- Set `yPos = 120 + 60` for yet another one.

Now, if we print `yPos`, we see that it's changed. For example, it could now be `180`. We could also modify our code to just use the updated value of `yPos`, such as setting `yPos = 120 + 100`.

## A More Effective Way: Incrementing Variables

While the above method lets us change variable values, it results in a lot of repetitive code. There’s a better way. 

We can use the expression:

`yPos = yPos + 20`

At first glance, this might seem strange. What we're really saying is: make the new `yPos` equal to the old `yPos` plus an extra 20.

For example:
- If `yPos` was `120`, after running this command, `yPos` is now `140`.
- After another run, `yPos` becomes `160`.
- This process can repeat as often as needed.

When we replace the previous individual assignments with this formula, the result (such as a column of ellipses) is the same, but now the change is more dynamic.

## Using the Draw Loop for Animation

Things get more interesting when we put these updates inside the `draw` function. 

Let's try moving just two lines into the `draw` function and comment out the previous drawing code for a clear screen.

Can you predict what will happen?

When we run this, we end up with an entire line of ellipses. That's because the `draw` function runs in a continuous loop. Each time through the loop, the value of `yPos` increases by 20, drawing another ellipse further down the screen.

Now, we're ready to animate.

## Smooth Animation and the Background Command

To make the movement smoother, we can change how much we add to `yPos` on each iteration. Instead of 20, let's add just 1.

When we save and run this, we see a smooth line of ellipses moving, because the shape moves by just one pixel at a time. To further create an animation, we can use the `background` command to clear the canvas each loop. Now, we see an animated ball moving down the screen.

## Manipulating Multiple Variables

Suppose you want to move the ball not just vertically, but horizontally too. We can declare another variable, such as `xPos`, initialize it, and use it in the code just like `yPos`. Then, apply the same updating formula, but with `xPos`.

What do you think will happen? The ball now moves diagonally, because it changes both the x and y positions by the same amount each frame.

## Experimenting Further

You can continue experimenting by:

- Changing the values added each frame to make the ball move faster.
- Adjusting the increment amounts for each axis to change the movement angle.
- Using negative values to make the ball move in the opposite direction.
- Creating variables to control the size or color of the ball as it moves.

Try making your own changes and see what you can create!
