# Making Variables for Adaptable Drawings

In this video, we'll start by showing you how you can make variables into easily adaptable drawings. But this is just the tip of the iceberg for what you can do with variables. 

Let’s begin with a demo drawing of a tree, sun, and clouds. For example, if I want to move the sun and make it slightly lower in the sky, it’s very straightforward. I just find the code for the sun and locate the argument controlling its Y position. To make the sun lower, I increase this number—let’s say to 200—so the sun moves down. Alternatively, I could make it 50 to move the sun higher in the sky. 

That’s fine with only one variable, but let’s look at the tree, which is a little more tricky.

## Moving the Tree

If I want to move the tree to the left, I could reduce its X position. However, you might notice that only the trunk moves; the leaves don’t move with it. Now I need to change a second number—the one controlling the position of the leaves. This means I have two numbers to adjust. That’s manageable for a small number of elements, but if you had lots of leaves, it would get very tedious.

## Creating Variables for Position

To solve this, let’s create a variable to control the position of the tree. The first step to creating a variable is to declare it. I declare it with the `VAR` keyword (that’s V-A-R), which tells the computer I want to create a new variable. Next, I type a name for the variable; I’ll use `treePos_x` to represent the x-position of the tree.

The next step is to initialise the variable. I declare my variables at the very top of the sketch, then initialise them in the setup function. All I do here is choose a starting value for `treePos_x`. For example, I can set `treePos_x = 156`. 

You might notice that as I’m typing, the Brackets editor suggests the name for me. This is called code completion. It’s very useful and speeds up typing, so you might want to let Brackets choose names for you.

Now that I’ve declared and initialised my variable, I need to actually use it. I go down to the ellipse commands, and where it previously said `156`, I replace that with `treePos_x`. You’ll see the code completion in action there.

Everything should look exactly the same in your sketch, which means you’ve done it correctly. Now, when you want to move the tree, it’s much easier: just change the value of `treePos_x`. For example, you could set it to `256` to move the tree to the middle, or `356` to move it to the right. This makes your code much more adaptable.

## Adjusting the Cloud

Now, let’s look at a more complicated problem with the cloud. The cloud actually consists of three parts. To start, I’ll declare a variable for the cloud position, called `cloudPos_x`. Being consistent with your variable names is good practice.

Next, I initialise this variable, using the same number that the first ellipse for the cloud uses. Now, I use this value in the code.

Here’s the issue: if I try to move the cloud by changing `cloudPos_x`, only one part of the cloud moves. If I try to use `cloudPos_x` in the other parts of the cloud, I realize that those values aren’t the same as the first one.

## Solving the Offset Problem with Arithmetic

There’s a solution. I can split these values into two parts and use a bit of arithmetic in my code. For example, instead of putting `130`, I write `100 + 30`. Instead of `150`, I write `100 + 50`. This way, the cloud appears the same, but we’ve now separated the base position and the offset.

Now, I can use my variable for the base position. Wherever I had `100`, I replace it with `cloudPos_x`. So, `cloudPos_x + 30` and `cloudPos_x + 50` are used for the positions. With this, all three ellipses that make up the cloud move together when I adjust `cloudPos_x`. You can try moving the cloud right by increasing the value.

You might also want to use a variable to adjust the size of the cloud. Let’s see how that works.

## Scaling the Cloud

To do this, I create a new variable called `cloudScale` and initialise it to `1`. Notice I make this a decimal number (for example, `1.0`). 

Now, I find all the parts of the cloud that adjust size—the width and height values in each ellipse. Each of these values should be multiplied by `cloudScale`. Once this is set up, the cloud still looks the same as before.

Now, I can reduce `cloudScale` to make the cloud smaller: set it to `0.7` to shrink the cloud, or even `0.2` to make it very small. Each time, the separate ellipses get smaller accordingly.

## Keeping the Cloud Together as it Scales

We’re almost there, but notice the pieces of the cloud don’t get any closer together as they shrink. To fix this, we also need to multiply the offsets that move the ellipses apart by `cloudScale`. So, if I had an offset of `30`, I use `30 * cloudScale`; for `50`, I use `50 * cloudScale`. 

Now, increasing `cloudScale` to `1.5` makes the cloud bigger, and reducing it to `0.5` makes the whole cloud into a cute little version. This lets you use the same code to make lots of clouds at different sizes or animate the clouds growing and shrinking in your sketch.

## Tidying Up Your Code

One more thing: as your code becomes longer, it might start looking messy. Here’s a nice tip for tidying up—split your commands onto separate lines. If you press Return in the middle of your arguments, your code becomes much more readable. Do this for each argument and notice how much clearer things look.

You can also add comments, like “this is for x position,” to remind yourself what each argument is doing. This technique really helps keep your code organised, especially when your function arguments get long.

## Try It Yourself!

Now, it’s your turn to go further and adapt the sketch. Try adding rays to the sunshine, creating more clouds, or adding more leaves to the tree. See what you can do!
