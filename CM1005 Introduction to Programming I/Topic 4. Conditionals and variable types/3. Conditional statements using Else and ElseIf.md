## Using `else` to Prescribe Actions for Unmet Conditions

Sometimes it's useful to prescribe an action for when a condition is not met. In the previous video, we did this using the "not equals" operator, but there is a neater way—by using the `else` keyword.

With `else`, you still have your condition and your action, but you can now add another action that happens if your condition turns out to be false.

### Simple Example

Consider a basic example we've seen before: when `name` equals Simon, it prints "Hello Simon". If it doesn't equal Simon, it says "Hey, your name isn't Simon." We can convert this logic to use the `else` keyword, which doesn't change the outputs but makes the code neater.

- When the name is Simon, the output is: **Hello Simon**.
- Change the name to Simone, and the output is: **Hey your name isn't Simon**.

By replacing the "not equals" condition with `else`, the logic and output remain the same.  
If you check the output after making this change:
- For Simon: "Hello Simon"
- For Simone: "Hey your name isn't Simon"

## Applying `else` in a More Complex Example: The Bomb Diffuser Game

Let's revisit our bomb diffuser game. In the key press event, if the key equals the secret key, you win (game state 3). If it doesn't, you lose (game state 2).

This pattern is the same as in the previous, simpler example. So, you can get rid of the "not equals" condition and just use the `else` keyword.

Testing this in the sketch:
- Press any key to start.
- The countdown works.
- Press the F key: you win the game.
- Press any key to start again.
- Press the G key: you lose the game.

So, the `else` keyword works as expected.

## Introducing `else if` for Multiple Conditions

Now, let's explore a more advanced concept: `else if`. This keyword allows us to set up multiple, chained conditions.

### How `else if` Works

First, you have a regular condition with its own action.  
If that one isn't met, you test a second condition. If the second is met, its action runs.  
If still not met, you continue to further `else if` statements.  
If none are met, you fall through to the final `else` action.

### Greeting Multiple People Example

Suppose we want to greet more than just Simon.  
Previously, with:

- If `name` equals Simon → "Hello Simon"

You can add:

- `else if` `name` equals Simone → "Hello Simone"
- `else if` `name` equals Sabina → "Hello Sabina"

You can have as many `else if` statements as you need for more names.  
It's also best to change the default else message to something broader, like "Hey, I don't know you."

Let's test:

- Set name to Simone → Output: "Hello Simone"
- Change to Sabina → "Hello Sabina"
- Set to Samantha → "Hey I don't know you" (since not programmed in)

## A More Intricate Example: Enhancing the Bomb Diffuser Game

To make the game more interesting and easier, introduce a second key—a "hot key." When players press this, it adds extra time to the countdown timer.

- Create a variable called `hotKey`, initialized like the secret key—set it to 'G'.
- In the key pressed event:
  - If key equals secret key: you win
  - Else if key equals hot key: add 20 to the countdown
  - Otherwise: you lose

Testing:
- Start the game and press any key.
- The countdown runs. 
- Press G: the countdown increases each time, giving more time.
- Press F: you win the game.
- Press another wrong key: you lose the game.

Everything works as expected. Let's make another tweak:  
Now, the bomb shouldn't blow up every time a wrong key is pressed.

- Add another `else if` with a random check (`random > 0.5`).
- If the random value is greater than 0.5, do nothing
- Otherwise, the bomb blows up.

This means that sometimes when you press the wrong key, the bomb blows up (roughly 50% of the time, since the random function without arguments generates values between 0 and 1).

- Try pressing wrong keys: sometimes the bomb blows up immediately; sometimes after a few tries.

## Potential Pitfalls with `else if` Chains

Let's return to the greeting example.  
Imagine you introduce another variable, `role`, which can be either "teacher" or "student":

- Set `role` to "teacher"
- Suppose you add: `else if role equals teacher: console.log "You're a teacher"`

If you change the name back to Simon and run the program, you might expect "Hello Simon" and "You're a teacher" to both print.  
But the console only shows "Hello Simon."

**Why?**  
As soon as one action in a chain of `if`/`else if`/`else` happens, none of the others are even tested. This is important to remember when writing conditional statements.

**Solution:**  
If you want two separate outputs, you need two separate sets of conditional statements—not chained together.

- Move the teacher check into its own `if` statement separately.

Now, you'll get both outputs:  
"Hello Simon" and "You are a teacher."

You might try to put the teacher check at the top as the primary `if`, with name checks as `else if` statements.  
But, if you do this, it will only print "You are a teacher"—none of the other actions, since the first condition is met and the rest are ignored.

**Rule of Thumb:**  
If you expect two different outputs to happen, you probably need separate conditional statements, not a single chain.

## Next Steps

Now, try going back to your hacker exercise and see if you can integrate some of these conditional structures into your work.
