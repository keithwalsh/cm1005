# Introduction

In the previous video, we explored the "equals to" operator and how to use it in conditional statements. In this video, we are going to focus on the "not equal to" operator. The "not equal to" operator is represented by an exclamation mark followed by the equals symbol (`!=`). When writing conditional statements, the exclamation mark generally signifies the concept of "not."

# Using the Not Equals Operator

Let's look at an example. Here, I've added a conditional statement to handle the situation when the variable `name` does not equal "Simon." In this case, the program will print to the console: "Hey your name isn't Simon."

We start with the same code example as before, now enhanced with this extra conditional statement:

- At first, `name` is set to "Simon." As expected, the output is "Hello Simon."
- If we modify the code to check:
  - If `name != "Simon"`, then it logs: "Hey you're not Simon."
- When we change `name` to a different value, like "Simone," we see the output changes to "Hey you're not Simon."

This is a basic example of how to use the not equals operator.

# Applying Not Equals in a Game: Bomb Defuser

Let's move on to something more complicated: the bomb defuser game. The next step is to implement game mechanics that require the player to press a hidden key to defuse the bomb.

## Setting Up the Secret Key

- We'll create a new variable named `secretKey`.
- Initialize `secretKey` to a letter, for example, `F`.

## Handling Key Presses

The special built-in variable `key` will hold the key that the player presses.

- To see how it works, log `key` to the console.
- When different keys are pressed (for example, G, H, J, K), they are output as capital letters. Therefore, our game will work with capital letters.

## Checking for a Win or Loss

When playing the game:

- We compare `key` to `secretKey`.
- If `key == secretKey`, the player wins, so we set `newState = 3`.
- If `key != secretKey`, the player loses, and we set `newState = 2`.

Here's how it plays out:

- Press any key to start. Then,
  - If you press the secret key (e.g., F), you win the game.
  - If you press a different key (e.g., G), you lose, and "Game over" is displayed.

# Adding a Countdown Timer

To increase the challenge, we introduce a countdown timer:

- Create a variable called `countDown`.
- In the key pressed events, when the player starts the game (when `gameState` switches from 0 to 1), initialize `countDown` to a high value such as 300.

## Decreasing the Countdown

- In the game loop (draw loop), whenever `gameState == 1` (i.e., the game is being played), decrement `countDown` by one each frame:
  - `countDown = countDown - 1`

Now, let's ensure the player can see the timer:

- Where you draw the text during the game, also draw the value of `countDown` on the screen, positioned at coordinates (20, [y]) for the top-left corner.

When you run the program, you might encounter an error (for example, using a capital "T" where a lowercase "t" is needed) but after correcting it, the countdown will be visible.

# Handling Countdown Reaching Zero

At this point, the countdown continues even into negative numbers. To address this:

- Add another conditional statement:
  - If `countDown == 0`, change `gameState` to 2, indicating the player ran out of time and lost the game.

When you run this version:

- Press any key to start.
- Watch the countdown decrease.
- When it reaches zero, "Game over" is displayed and you lose.

# Further Improvements and Exercises

There are now several elements of the game working, but more can be added. In future videos, we'll enhance the game further. In the meantime, try improving the game yourself:

- Randomize the secret key.
- Introduce lives to give players more attempts to defuse the bomb.

Once you’ve done this, you may also want to look at the "hacked" exercise for more ideas.
