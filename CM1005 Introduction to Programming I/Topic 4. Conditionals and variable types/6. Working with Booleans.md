# Working with Boolean Variables

Now we've covered types, and we're going to look in a bit more detail—and in practice—at Boolean variables.

## Setting Up: The Robot Example

For this, I've enlisted the hacket robot to help, and we're going to make his antenna flash.

We start by creating a new Boolean variable called `antennaOn` and set it equal to `false`. This is done in the same sketch you used in Topic 1. You can download the updated version next to this video, or use your earlier file.

So, we have our new Boolean variable, which is set to `false`. Currently, to draw the antenna on the robot, we've set the fill to a bright yellow color. We then draw the ellipse, which you can see in the final sketch, as a nice bright yellow with a thick black outline.

Let's change things so that:

- If `antennaOn == true`, we use our nice bright yellow.
- If the antenna is off, we just need the `else` keyword. Remember: with Booleans, they're either on or off, `true` or `false`. They are made for `if, else` statements.

For the `else` case, let's set the fill to a different color: a pale yellow (just increase the blue channel to 200 to make it closer to white). Save and see that, because `antennaOn` is set to `false`, the robot's antenna is now a pale yellow. If you change this value to `true`, it will become bright yellow again. All of this is controlled by the `if` statement, which sets the fill color to bright yellow if `antennaOn` is `true`, and a dull yellow if it is `false`.

## Adding User Interaction

It's not ideal that a user has to change the code to switch the robot's antenna. Let's make it interactive!

At the bottom (after `draw`), let's create the `mousePressed` function.

Remember: `mousePressed` is a function that P5 provides—a hook that is called whenever the user presses the mouse. When the user presses the mouse, we want to switch the value of `antennaOn`, which in turn will switch the color.

We want:
- If `antennaOn == true`, set `antennaOn = false`.
- Otherwise, set `antennaOn = true`.

Remember:
- Use `==` when checking for equality, for example: `if (antennaOn == true)`.
- Use `=` (a single equal sign) when assigning a value, for example: `antennaOn = false`.

Now, when you click the mouse, the color of the antenna changes from bright yellow to pale yellow. You can keep clicking to switch between the two states. This is because of the `if` statement, which works regardless of the current state of the variable.

## Making the Code Tidier

We can make the code even neater with some Boolean shorthand.

For example, instead of:

- `if (antennaOn == true)`

You can simply write:

- `if (antennaOn)`

Why? Because `antennaOn` itself is a Boolean: either `true` or `false`. The `if` statement expects a Boolean value, so just passing the variable is enough.

Similarly, to toggle the value of `antennaOn`, you can use negation:

- `antennaOn = !antennaOn`

This flips `antennaOn` from `true` to `false`, or from `false` to `true`. This little trick makes the code much shorter (about five lines saved) and is much tidier. Save and run it—everything works exactly the same way!

Now, you've created a neat little blinking robot that responds to user interaction with the mouse.

## Automating the Antenna

Of course, robots should be automated. We shouldn't need to press a button to make the antenna switch on and off.

Let's remove the mousePressed function, and instead, put the line that switches `antennaOn = !antennaOn` into the `draw` function, before we draw the antenna. This should make the antenna switch every frame from on to off.

When you run it, you might notice that it's switching far too quickly—you'll just barely see the yellow flickering. This happens because the frame rate is too fast to see the effect.

## Slowing Down the Flashing

To slow down the flashing, we can use a built-in variable in P5 called `frameCount`, which increases by one every single frame.

If we want something to happen only every so many frames, we use a simple mathematical mechanism:

- `if (frameCount / 100 == parseInt(frameCount / 100)) { ... }`

Place your code to flip the antenna inside those curly brackets.

Now, you'll see that the antenna switches off and on about once every 100 frames.

How does it work? `parseInt` gives you the integer value of the division. So, for example, when `frameCount` goes from 99 to 100, `frameCount / 100` is `1`, and so `parseInt(frameCount / 100)` is `1`. This condition is only `true` once every 100 frames, slowing down the effect and making the antenna's flashing visible.

In this video, we've taken a bit of time to look at Booleans in practice and played with our hacket robot example. In the next video, we'll look at different types of conditionals, such as checking for equality and checking whether a number is greater or less than another value, with examples.
