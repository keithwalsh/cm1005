# Getting Started with Game Project Three: Game Interaction

In this video, I’m going to show you how to get started with Game Project Three – Game Interaction. In this part of the project, we’ll use the character drawings you’ve made and attach them to interactions using keystrokes. You’ll be able to move your character left, right, make them jump, and see all of this nicely animated with your images.

---

## 1. Creating Variables for Interactions

The first stage is to create variables for your character’s interactions. These variables need to be declared and initialized. In my example, I’ve already declared:

- `isLeft`
- `isRight`
- `isPlummeting`
- `isFalling`

These are initialized in the `setup` method. You can do the same in your own setup.

## 2. Handling Key Presses: Left and Right

Next, let's implement movement for the left and right keys using the `keyPressed` function.

Go to your sketch and scroll down to your `keyPressed` function. At the moment, I am console logging two values: `key` and `keyCode`.

Run the sketch and open the live preview. Clear the console and press the left arrow key. You’ll notice two things are printed out: when you press the left arrow, you get a percentage sign (`%`) and `37`. This is because the built-in variable `key` gives you `%`, while `keyCode` gives you `37`. The `key` value is a special key and not very meaningful here, but `keyCode` is more reliable for detecting arrow keys. Therefore, we’ll use `keyCode`.

You can write a conditional to detect if a key is being pressed:

- `if (keyCode == 37)` detects if the left arrow is pressed. For now, you can `console.log("left arrow")` for testing.

Press the left arrow and you'll see "left arrow" in the console. Other keys will not print this, which is what we want.

Now, let's detect the right arrow. Press the right arrow—`key` shows an apostrophe, but `keyCode` is `39`. So, add:

- `else if (keyCode == 39) console.log("right arrow");`

Now you can see both left and right arrows trigger their respective messages.

## 3. Setting and Unsetting Movement Variables

Now, instead of simply logging information, we need to actually set our movement variables. We have `isLeft` and `isRight`, both initialized as `false`. 

- When the left arrow is pressed, set `isLeft = true;` (Remember to use a single equals sign for assignment.)
- When the right arrow is pressed, set `isRight = true;`

Next, you’ll need to do the same thing in the `keyReleased` function, except set the variables to `false`:

- When the left arrow is released, set `isLeft = false;`
- When the right arrow is released, set `isRight = false;`

For testing, you may want to print the values of your `isLeft` and `isRight` variables to the console, but we’ll move on for now.

## 4. Adding the Game Character Code

Now comes the fun part: adding the code to draw your game character. You’ll need your completed Part Two A where you drew your character.

- Open your Part Two A code in another window (for example, using a new Brackets window).
- Copy the code for your standing, front-facing character (don’t copy the parts where you set `gameChar_x` and `gameChar_y`, just the drawing code).
- Paste this drawing code into your current sketch at the appropriate location.

Next, add the code for the character facing left. Find your drawing for "walking, turned left" (again, copy only the drawing code, not where you set `gameChar_x` or `gameChar_y`), and insert it in the appropriate place in your code, inside the conditional for `isLeft`. Pay attention to indentation after pasting.

Repeat for "walking, turned right." For the purposes of this lesson, you'll need to add more animation states yourself.

Now, when you press the left arrow, your character faces left. When you press the right arrow, your character faces right and so on.

---

## 5. Moving the Character

To make your character actually move, go to the `draw` function. Here, you’ll add two conditional statements:

- When `isLeft` is `true`, the character should move left.
- When `isRight` is `true`, the character should move right.

To do this, change `gameChar_x`:

- For left movement:  
  `if (isLeft == true) { gameChar_x -= 1; }`  
  This moves the character left by decreasing the x value.
- For right movement:  
  `if (isRight == true) { gameChar_x += 1; }`  
  This increases the x value, moving the character right.

Try it out: press the left and right arrows and watch the character move accordingly. If the movement is too slow, try increasing the value (for example, move by 5 pixels at a time instead of 1).

That’s how to get started with Game Project Part Three! There are still lots more stages to complete — I’ll leave those for you to explore.
