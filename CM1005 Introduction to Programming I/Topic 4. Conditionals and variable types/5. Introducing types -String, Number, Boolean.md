## Introduction

Now you've learned a bit about conditional statements, we're going to turn our attention back to variables and look in more detail at the types of variables that JavaScript offers us. The skills you've learned in this lesson will make your conditionals and programs even more powerful. We're also going to look at a new type: booleans.

## Recap: Variable Types Seen So Far

First, let's take a moment to have a quick recap on what you've seen so far. We've shown you a few types of variables:

- **Numbers**, as shown by the declaration on the left, which creates a new number variable called `num`.
- On the right is the declaration for an **object literal**, a collection of values about a particular thing, such as an ellipse or a rectangle.

We have used number variables and objects in our simple drawing applications.

## Number Variables

You can create number variables for:
- Whole numbers (integers)
- Floating point numbers with a decimal place

Number variables can also be signed, storing negative numbers. On the left of this graphic are a range of valid number declarations—whole numbers or integers such as `rectX` and `speed_y`, along with floating point numbers and zero.

When you have numbers, you will probably want to do some arithmetic with them using math operators such as multiplication and division. The other types we'll uncover in this video don't normally need mathematical operations, but we will see ways in which one or two of these symbols are used.

## Boolean Variables

Okay, onto a new type: **boolean** or **bool** variable, named after George Boole, the English logician. Boolean variables are either `true` or `false`. They can only store one of these two values. Like a light switch, they are either on or off—or, in binary terms, either 0 or 1.

You declare and assign values to booleans the same way as numbers:
- You use the keyword `var` followed by a name.

In the examples on this graphic, two booleans are declared. One could be `play` and the other could be `pause`.  
- `play` is declared and assigned to `true` all in one line.  
- With `pause`, the declaration is on the first line and then the assignment to `false` is on the next, just as you can do with number variables, declaring the variable at the top of the sketch and then assigning the value in setup.

We are going to take a detailed look at the practice of using booleans in the next video. So, when you're ready to move on from this one, check it out.

## String Variables

For now, let's move to our next variable type: **strings**. Pieces of text—such as individual characters, words, sentences, or even whole books—can be stored as strings in your program.

As you have probably guessed, you create a string by using the `var` keyword and the name. If you want to do your assignment the right way, you can put an equal sign followed by the string value as shown in these examples. Notice that the string is encased in either single or double quotes.

It doesn't normally matter which you choose, although we will look at some examples later in this video where you need to be more careful. However, you should try and be consistent with your choice of either single or double quotes in your code, as it makes it more readable.

## String Operations: Concatenation

While you can't do arithmetic with strings, a very useful operation is **concatenation**, and you will use this a lot in your programs. Concatenation is a long-winded word for combining two strings into one. We complete this operation using the plus (`+`) operator.

For example, in the graphic, the strings "hello" and "world" are combined into one and assigned to `string3`, which stores the string "hello world". Concatenation is done using the plus operator between two string variables. Or, in the case of `string4`, the absolute string "goodbye"—which is not stored in a variable but is concatenated with `string2`—just as we have seen with magic numbers.

You need to be careful, however, as we are using the same symbol to denote different operations depending on the type of variable. For numbers, JavaScript will perform addition. However, if they are strings, JavaScript will concatenate them.

## Mixed-Type Operations

What happens if we add a string to a number? When attempting to use these operations on these types, JavaScript will make different assumptions depending on the situation. This can cause unexpected behaviors.

It's not all a bad thing—JavaScript has some tools to help us out:
- The `typeof` function allows us to check whether a variable is a number, string, boolean, or object.
- We can **cast variables**, changing them from one type to another.

Okay, let's look at some code and we'll explore some of these ideas.
