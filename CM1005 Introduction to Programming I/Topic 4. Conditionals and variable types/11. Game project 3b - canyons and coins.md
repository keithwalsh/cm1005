## Introduction

By now, you should have completed the first part of game project three. If you haven't quite got there, go back and finish it up. When you're done, you should have a character that can move left and right across the ground, and can jump forward and to both sides. 

## Adding Interaction to the Game

We're now going to add more interaction to our game, giving it more of a point. We'll take the collectable code, and enable the character to pick up the collectable.

### Copying the Collectable Code

- Re-open game project two.
- Copy the variable for the collectable.
- Paste it into your sketch for game project three.
- We are continuing to work on the same sketch file that you built up and started in part A—so there's nothing new to download.

Next, locate the object you assigned to the collectable (again, from project two, part B):

- Copy the collectable object.
- Paste it into the `setup` function of your current project.

After that, scroll down to find the drawing code for the collectable. 

- Copy this drawing code and paste it into your `draw` function, just before you start drawing the game character.
- Make sure you include the comment as well, so you know exactly where you are in the code.

If you now save and run your code, you’ll see that the collectable is being drawn. Note that this may affect the outline of your game character. To fix this, ensure that you set the game character’s stroke color (e.g., set it back to black) after drawing the collectable.

## Setting Up Collectable Detection

After copying in the collectable, you need to add a property called `isFound` to the collectable object and set it to `false`.

- In your collectable object declaration, add a comma, then `isFound: false`.  
  This sets up the collectable so that, initially, it has not been found.

Before drawing the collectable, you need to test whether it has already been found. 

- Wrap the drawing code for the collectable in an `if` statement:
    - Only draw the collectable if `collectable.isFound` is equal to `false`.

Wrap all the drawing code (from `noFill` down to the end) in curly braces so it is only executed while `isFound` is `false`. 

If you run the code now, there should be no changes in behavior: since `isFound` is `false`, the collectable will still be drawn. If you set `isFound` to `true` in the object, the collectable will no longer be drawn.

## Detecting When the Character Collects the Item

To make the collectable disappear when collected, you need JavaScript to set the `isFound` property to `true` when the game character has run over it.

- Write an `if` statement that becomes true when the game character is in range of the collectable.

### Using the `dist` Function

We will use the `dist` function for this. If you need a reminder of how `dist` works, review the assignments video from earlier in the topic.

The `dist` function requires four arguments: the x and y positions of two points.

- The first two arguments should be the x and y of the character (e.g., `gameChar_x`, `gameChar_y`).
- The last two arguments should be the x and y of the collectable; for this, use the properties on the collectable object using dot notation (e.g., `collectable.x_pos`, `collectable.y_pos`).

This calculates the distance between the character and the collectable.

- Set your condition so that if the distance is less than 20, you know that the character is right over the collectable.
- Remember: do **not** put a semicolon at the end of the `if` statement!
- Open and close your curly braces to contain the body of the `if` statement.

If the character is in range, set `collectable.isFound` to `true`.

When you run your code, the collectable will appear on the screen because `isFound` is `false`. When you move the character over the collectable, it will disappear—because `isFound` is now `true` and the drawing code is skipped.

## Next Steps

There are some more features to add after completing this part:

- Draw the canyon
- Test falling down the canyon

For the canyon, you **won't** use the `dist` function. Instead, use the collision detection methods demonstrated in an earlier video.
