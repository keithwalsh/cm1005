# Logical Operators: AND and OR

We've got one more important addition to your conditional statements toolbox: logical operators. In this section, we'll focus on two logical operators — **AND** and **OR**.

---

## The OR Operator (`||`)

Let's look at the OR operator first. In code, the OR operator is represented by two pipe symbols together (`||`). You may not have typed the pipe symbol before. On a MacBook Pro keyboard, it's above the `\` key. On a PC, it may be located in a different place; take a moment to find it and try typing it somewhere.

Suppose we have two conditions in a conditional statement:  
- Condition A: for example, `name == Simon`  
- Condition B: for example, `name == Simone`

With the OR operator:
- If A is true and B is false, the action will happen.
- If B is true and A is false, the action will happen.
- If both are true, the action will still happen.

Let's look at how this works in some code.

---

### Example: Welcoming Roles

Suppose the code checks the user's role:

- If `role == student`, the program prints "Hi, welcome to Goldsmiths."
- Otherwise, it prints "Hey, I don't know you."

If the role is `student`, the output is "Hi, welcome to Goldsmiths."  
If the role is changed to `teacher`, the output is "Hey, I don't know you."

Suppose we want the program to welcome both students and teachers. To do this, we'll use the OR operator:

- **Modify the condition** to add the OR operator: `role == student || role == teacher`. 

A common mistake is to write something like `role == student || teacher`, but this won't work. Each condition separated by the OR operator must be a full condition, so you need to repeat `role == teacher`.

If you change the role to `assistant` and run the code, it says "Hey, I don't know you." To include assistants as well, add another OR: `role == student || role == teacher || role == assistant`. The output for each included role will now be "Hi, welcome to Goldsmiths."

---

### Example: Bomb Defuser Game (OR)

Let's consider a more realistic example from the bomb defuser game.

Previously, pressing a specific hotkey added time to the countdown timer. Now, we'll make the game easier by allowing several hotkeys. We'll add a couple of variables:

- `hotKey1`, initialized to `'H'`
- `hotKey2`, initialized to `'J'`

Now, in your code where you previously checked `else if (key == hotKey)`, you can extend it using ORs:

- `else if (key == hotKey1 || key == hotKey2)`

When you run the game:
- Pressing `G`, `H`, or `J` will add time to the countdown.
- Pressing any other key has no effect, and eventually, the bomb will go off.

---

## The AND Operator (`&&`)

Now, let's look at the AND operator. The AND operator is represented in code by two ampersands: `&&`. The difference is that **both conditions must be true** for the overall statement to be true.

Suppose:

- Condition A: `name == Simon`
- Condition B: `role == teacher`

Both conditions must be met for the action to happen—so to get the "Hi, welcome to Goldsmiths" message, the name must be Simon **and** the role must be teacher. If either one is false, the action will not occur.

---

### Example: Combining Conditions with AND

Let’s return to the earlier example and update it to use the AND operator:

- Introduce a variable `name` and set it to `Simon`.
- Modify the condition to check `role == teacher && name == Simon`.

If both these conditions are true, the program prints "Hi, welcome to Goldsmiths." If only one (or neither) is true (for example, if `role` is `assistant`), it prints "Hey, I don't know you."  
If we change the role back to `teacher`, the output is "Hi, welcome to Goldsmiths" again.

---

### Impossible Conditions

It’s possible to make a logic error by testing the same variable for two different values with AND:

- For example: `role == teacher && role == assistant`

This will never be true, because a variable can't have two values at the same time. If you find yourself writing a condition like this, remember that you'll need to be testing two different things when you use AND. However, you can chain multiple ANDs to test for many required, separate conditions:

- Example: `name == Simon && id == 974223` (add as many as you need)

---

### Example: Bomb Defuser Game (AND)

Let’s return to our bomb defuser game and make it harder. Now, the user has to press two keys—one after the other—in order to diffuse the bomb.

- Create a variable `secretKey1` (for example, the key `'D'`)
- Create a variable `previousKey` and initialize it to an empty string

Now, in your key press logic:

1. When `gameState == 1`, store the latest key press in `previousKey` at the end of the round:  
   `previousKey = key`

2. When the game switches to state 1, set `previousKey` back to an empty string.

3. In your condition, write:  
   `if (previousKey == secretKey && key == secretKey1)`

This requires both keys to be pressed in the right order to win the game.

However, the first time you play, `previousKey` has not yet been pressed, so this alone won’t work. To fix that, add logic to check if `previousKey` is empty:

- If `previousKey` is blank, do nothing.
- Otherwise, use your AND condition as an `else if`.

---

#### Testing This Out

If you try pressing any key to start and then press `D` and then `F`, you might find it doesn’t work at first. If you had the keys in the wrong order, swap them so that the correct sequence is required:  
- First `D`, then `F`.

Once the correct order has been established, the game can be won by pressing those keys in sequence.

---

### Handling Incorrect Key Presses

The game is still quite hard, because if you press the wrong key at the beginning, `previousKey` may hold the wrong value. You can catch this situation by checking if one of the correct keys has been pressed:

- Example: `if (key == secretKey)` — and do nothing in that case.

However, using many empty if statements is messy; a neater way is to use the OR operator as appropriate.

---

#### Final Testing

Play the game again:

- Press any key to start.
- If you start with the wrong key, try again.
- Set the countdown higher if you need more time (for example, to 1,000).
- Try pressing the correct key sequence—D, then F—and you should win the game.

## Practice with Logical Operators

You now have a powerful range of tools for conditional logic. Mastery takes practice, so work with them as much as possible.  
Now, go back to the HackIt exercise and see if you can integrate some AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`) operators of your own!
